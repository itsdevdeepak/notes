# Notes

A simple note-taking web application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Run Locally

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/itsdevdeepak/notes
    ```

2.  Open `index.html` in your browser.

    ```bash
    # Simply open index.html in your browser
    ```

    Alternatively, use a local development server (e.g., VS Code's Live Server) for hot reloading:

    ```bash
    # If using VS Code:
    # 1. Install the "Live Server" extension.
    # 2. Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server".
    ```

## Development Setup (Optional)

For contributing or advanced usage, set up linting, formatting, and type checking:

1.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
